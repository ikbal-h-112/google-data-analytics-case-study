##### INTRODUCTION & SCENARIO
“You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.”

This project will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

##### ABOUT THE COMPANY
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Ask

##### Business Task
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?

##### Key Stakeholders

● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy
learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic
achieve them.

● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program


## Prepare

Data Located: Here is the data link https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Data Organization: 12 months data used from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021 for the analysis. 

Bias and Credibility : The data satisfies the ROCCC standard which means that it is reliable, original, comprehensive, current and cited.

Data Limitations:  Some null valus were presented in the data , they were deleted. 

## Process Phase

The process phase check check for error , cleaning and transforming the data and to do all this I used RStudio as my tool.
My initial task was to install the relevant packages and loading the data sets.

Here are the data cleaning and transforming steps in bullet point

* Install and loading packages
* Loading all 12 months data
* Combined all the data and make a single data frame
* Extracted new column week_day, month, day, year, date from started_at column.
* Created a new column as ride_length by subtracting ended_at, started_at
* Changed the data type of ride_length to numeric
* Deleted null values
* Deleted negative values
* Removed latitude and longitude type columns from main data frame and created a sub data frame using them for separate visualizations
* Created a new column ride_routes combining started_station_at and end ended_station_at column 
* Sorted by month(January) and week name(Monday) of month and week_days column


##### Installing Packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
library(lubridate)
```
```{r}
install.packages("skimr")
```


```{r}
library(skimr)
```

##### Loading datasets

Data set loaded using the month name of the year 2021 from January to December

```{r}
jan<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202101-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202102-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202103-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202104-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202105-divvy-tripdata.csv")
june<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
july<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202108-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec<- read_csv("/Users/ikbalhossain/Documents/projects/Google_Analytics /Case Study/datas/CSV/202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")

```

Binding the data
```{r}
trip_datas<-bind_rows(jan, feb, mar, apr, may, june, july, aug, sep, oct,nov, dec)
```
Showing few rows using head() function
```{r}
head(trip_datas)
```
Using str() function we can check the overall structure of th data

```{r}
str(trip_datas)
```
lets see the summary of the data set

```{r}
skim_without_charts(trip_datas)
```
Extracting month, day, year, week days from started at column to get better insights from the dataset

```{r}
trip_datas$date <- as.Date(trip_datas$started_at)
trip_datas$month <- format(as.Date(trip_datas$date),"%B")
trip_datas$day <- format(as.Date(trip_datas$date),"%d")
trip_datas$year <- format(as.Date(trip_datas$date),"%Y")
trip_datas$week_day <- weekdays(trip_datas$date)
```

Now lets make another column to show the ride length of each trip
to do that we will subtract strated_at column from ended_at column.
And the units using as minutes

```{r}
trip_datas$ride_length <- difftime(trip_datas$ended_at,trip_datas$started_at,units = "min")
```

Now lets round the vaue to 2 decimal and make the column numeric using below function

```{r}
trip_datas$ride_length <- round(trip_datas$ride_length,2)
trip_datas$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(trip_datas$ride_length))
str(trip_datas)
```

## Cleaning the data

For cleaning data lets frop all the null values first
```{r}
trip_datas <- drop_na(trip_datas)
dim(trip_datas)
```
Now lets see if we have any negative value in our ride length column
```{r}
filter(trip_datas,ride_length<0)
```
We have 116 rows of negative ride length, lets remove those and make a new data frame where ride length are > 0
```{r}
trip_datas<- filter(trip_datas, ride_length>0)
```

Now lets make a separate data frame as lat_long to make visualization of this later 
after that extract lat and long columns from trip_datas 

```{r}
lat_lng1 <- select(trip_datas,start_station_name,end_station_name,start_lat,start_lng,end_lat,end_lng,member_casual)

# Extracting latitude and longitude from trip_datas
trip_datas <- trip_datas %>%
  select (-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))

```

## Analysis

In the analysis phase the goal is to identify the relationship and trends in data which will help to solve the business task. 
Lets explore further.

```{r}
# Percentage of annual member and casual member
count_members <- table(trip_datas$member_casual)
sum(count_members)
percentage <- 100*count_members/sum(count_members)
percentage

```
There are 44.6% Casual member and 55.4% Annual member


Types of bikes
```{r}
# Type of bikes
unique(trip_datas$rideable_type)
```
3 types of bike


```{r}
# types of bike riden by each member type
trip_datas %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% count(rideable_type,sort=FALSE)
```
For both Casual and member most favorite is classic_bike and also we can see that for annual member they don't like docked bike that much.


Let's run few calculation to find out max, mean , min ride length for both member type
```{r}
#mean
trip_datas %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(rides_number=n(),mean(ride_length))
#max
trip_datas %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(rides_number=n(),max(ride_length))
#min
trip_datas %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(rides_number=n(),min(ride_length))

# summary statistics of ride length across members
summary(trip_datas$ride_length)

```

As our business task is mainly focus on converting the Casual members to Annual member lets do our further analysis focused on Casual members

But first lets sort out the month and week column from January to December and Monday to Sunday
```{r}
#month
trip_datas$month <- 
  ordered(trip_datas$month, levels=
            c( "January", "February", "March", "April", "May","June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))

#week
trip_datas$week_day <- ordered(trip_datas$week_day, levels=
                                 c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))
```


##### Stations
```{r}
#most used start stations by casual riders
most_used_stations <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name,member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual") %>%
  select(start_station_name,number_count)
most_used_stations
```


```{r}
#least used start stations casual riders 
least_used_start_stations <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name,member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(number_count) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual") %>%
  select(start_station_name,number_count)
least_used_start_stations
```


```{r}
#most used end stations by casual riders
most_used_end_stations <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name,member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual") %>%
  select(end_station_name,number_count)
most_used_end_stations
```


```{r}
#least used end stations by casual riders
least_used_end_stations <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name,member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange((number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual") %>%
  select(end_station_name,number_count)
least_used_end_stations
```


##### By Month
```{r}
#mostly used start stations by each month by casual riders
most_used_start_stations_by_month <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,month,start_station_name) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
most_used_start_stations_by_month
```

```{r}
#mostly used end stations by each month by casual riders
most_used_end_stations_by_month <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,month,end_station_name) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
most_used_end_stations_by_month
```
Streeter Dr & Grand Ave is the most popular station(start & end) in summer season.



```{r}
#mostly rided months by casual riders
most_rided_months_by_casual <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,month) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
most_rided_months_by_casual

```
From April the no of rides increases where July takes the peak count. On the other hand November takes significantly drop and continues till March where February has the lowest count.

```{r}
# mean ride length by casual riders each months
mean_ride_length_by_month <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,month) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n(),mean=mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
mean_ride_length_by_month
```
February has the highest average of ride length because of low number of rides


##### By Week
```{r}
#mostly rided week days by casual riders
most_rided_weekDays_by_casual <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(number_count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
most_rided_weekDays_by_casual
```


```{r}
# mean ride length by casual riders each week
mean_ride_length_by_week <- trip_datas %>%
  group_by(member_casual,week_day) %>%
  summarise(number_count=n(),mean=mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean)) %>%
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
mean_ride_length_by_week
```

Saturday and Sunday has the highest number of ride count and mean ride length count by the casual members. Reason for this is holiday. It could be a good target marketing for this two days.



Mean peak hours by week days 
```{r}
#Mean peak hours of week days by casual rider
peak_hour <- trip_datas %>%
  group_by(week_day,member_casual) %>% summarize(mean(started_at),mean(ended_at)) %>% filter(member_casual=="casual")
peak_hour
```

Now lets combined start and end stations name to make route and save it as trip_datas_v2

```{r}
trip_datas_v2 <- (unite(trip_datas, "ride_routes", start_station_name, end_station_name, sep= " to "))
```

##### Top 10

```{r}
# top_10 routes 
top_10_routes <- trip_datas_v2 %>% 
  group_by(ride_routes) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% head(10)
top_10_routes
```


```{r}
# top_10 routes by number of rides by casual member
top_10_routes_casual <- trip_datas_v2 %>% 
  group_by(ride_routes,member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual")
head(top_10_routes_casual,10)
```
As we see that saturday and sunday has highest ride count by casual member 
lets see their top 10 route this two days
```{r}
# top_10 routes by number of rides by casual member On Saturday
top_10_routes_casual_saturday <- trip_datas_v2 %>% 
  group_by(ride_routes,member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual", week_day=="Saturday")
head(top_10_routes_casual_saturday,10)
```
```{r}
# top_10 routes by number of rides by casual member on Sunday
top_10_routes_casual_sunday <- trip_datas_v2 %>% 
  group_by(ride_routes,member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual", week_day=="Sunday")
head(top_10_routes_casual_sunday,10)
```

Top 10 start and End station Saturday and Sunday by casual member

##### Saturday
```{r}
#top 10 start station saturday
top_10_start_station_casual_saturday <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name,member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual", week_day=="Saturday")
head(top_10_start_station_casual_saturday,10)
```
```{r}
# top 10 end station saturday
top_10_end_station_casual_saturday <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name,member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual", week_day=="Saturday")
head(top_10_end_station_casual_saturday,10)
```
##### Sunday
```{r}
#top 10 start station Sunday
top_10_start_station_casual_sunday <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name,member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual", week_day=="Sunday")
head(top_10_start_station_casual_sunday,10)
```
```{r}
# top 10 end station sunday
top_10_end_station_casual_sunday <- trip_datas %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name,member_casual,week_day) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  filter(member_casual== "casual", week_day=="Sunday")
head(top_10_end_station_casual_sunday,10)
```
##### Key Finding after analysis

* There are 44.6% Casual member and 55.4% Annual member
* 3 types of bike  "classic_bike"  "electric_bike" "docked_bike"
* For both Casual and member most favorite is classic_bike
* Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
  0.02     6.95    12.20    21.81    22.12 55944.15 

Now Focusing on Casual riders as our goal is to convert casual riders to annual member

* Streeter Dr & Grand Ave is the most popular station(start & end) in summer season for casual rider
* From May the no of rides increases where July takes the peak count. On the other hand November takes significantly drop and continues till March where February has     the lowest count.
* February has the highest average of ride length because of low number of rides
* Saturday and Sunday has the highest number of ride count and mean ride length count by the casual members. Reason for this is holiday. It could be a good target          marketing for this two days.

## Act

After Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, now we are at act phase.
After analyzing the data here is my top 3 recommendations.


* 1. Cyclistic company could consider implementing a promotional campaign aimed at casual members who frequently ride on Saturdays and Sundays. In order to encourage more rides on weekdays, the company may want to offer a new membership discount specifically for those days, focusing on the most frequently used start and end stations. This could help to increase the number of rides taken by casual members on weekdays, while also incentivizing continued weekend use.


* 2. To encourage more ridership during the low seasons of winter and spring, Cyclistic company could consider offering a seasonal membership with discounts. A potential promotion to attract casual riders might include a free 7-day membership trial, highlighting the benefits and convenience of becoming a member. By leveraging the lower demand of these seasons, Cyclistic could potentially increase its membership base and rider loyalty.
